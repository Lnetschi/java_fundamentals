Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

*** Will print out both Parent Called and Child Called because the method is not calling the object to do anything so
each class should just print in order of parent class first then child class.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
